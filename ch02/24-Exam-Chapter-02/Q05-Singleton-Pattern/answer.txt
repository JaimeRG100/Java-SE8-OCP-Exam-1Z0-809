B is correct, as the constructor of the singleton class must be private, else other classes would be able to instantiate it, breaking the singleton pattern.
E is correct, as the purpose of a singleton is to ensure that all threads share the same instance of the object in memory. 
F is correct, as a public static method is required for all threads to access the same singleton.
